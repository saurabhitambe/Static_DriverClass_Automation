Project Description:

I have created "Static_DriverClass_Framework" project to automate all types of APIs like SOAP and REST using RestAssured.

1) Capabilities to automate and Validation:
     > Rest : POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and GET

2) In this project there are four different classes created

All methods execution is done by using their respective driver classes.
